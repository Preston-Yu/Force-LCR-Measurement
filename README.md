# LabVIEW Program for Pressure and Resistance Measurement

This guide explains how to use the `Lab1.0.vi` LabVIEW program to measure resistance and pressure using an LCR meter and a force measurement device.

---

## Chapter 1: Preparation

### Step 1: Power on all measurement devices
Ensure that both the LCR meter and the force measurement device are powered on and properly connected to the PC via USB or serial interface.



---

### Step 2: Launch NI MAX

![NI MAX](./img/ni_max.png)

Open **NI Measurement & Automation Explorer (NI MAX)** on your PC.



---

### Step 3: Click ‚ÄúDevices and Interfaces‚Äù and wait for detection

![NI MAX Devices](./img/nimax_devices.png)

In NI MAX, click on the left-side menu **Devices and Interfaces**. Wait for all connected hardware to be detected.



---

### Step 4: Confirm connections and note VISA names or COM ports

Ensure both the LCR meter and force measurement device are listed. Note their respective VISA resource names (e.g., `USB0::0xXXXX::...`) or COM port numbers (e.g., `COM3`).

## Chapter 2: Measurement

### Step 1: Open `Lab1.0.vi`
![Lab 1.0](./img/Lab1.0.png)

Launch LabVIEW and open the file named `Lab1.0.vi`.

---

### Step 2: If prompted, click ‚ÄúRun‚Äù

![LabVIEW Run](./img/labview_run.png)

If LabVIEW shows a warning or dialog, click the **Run** button to start the VI.



---

### Step 3: Main interface

![Main UI](./img/main_ui.png)

The main interface contains:
- Device selection dropdowns
- Parameter settings (frequency, sample count, etc.)



---

### Step 4: Select the correct VISA names or COM ports

![Select Devices Name1](./img/select_devices_name1.png)

![Select Devices Name2](./img/select_devices_name2.png)

From the dropdown lists, select the appropriate VISA resource or serial port for the LCR meter and the force measurement device.

---

### Step 5: Set measurement parameters (cannot be changed after starting)

![Parameters1](./img/parameters1.png)

In the main interface, you can select the **Primary Parameter** and **Secondary Parameter** for measurement using the dropdown menus.

Below is a brief description of the common parameters:

- `Z` ‚Äì **Impedance** (magnitude of the total complex impedance)
- `Y` ‚Äì **Admittance** (inverse of impedance)
- `R` ‚Äì **Resistance** (real part of impedance)
- `Rp` ‚Äì **Parallel resistance**
- `Rs` ‚Äì **Series resistance**
- `G` ‚Äì **Conductance** (inverse of resistance)
- `C` ‚Äì **Capacitance**
- `Cp` ‚Äì **Parallel capacitance**
- `Cs` ‚Äì **Series capacitance**
- `Q` ‚Äì **Quality factor**
- `D` ‚Äì **Dissipation factor**

> üìò *For more detailed definitions and appropriate usage of these parameters, please refer to the official user manual of your LCR meter.*

![Parameters2](./img/parameters2.png)
![Parameters3](./img/parameters3.png)

The connected devices (such as the LCR meter and force measurement unit) offer a set of **predefined sampling frequencies**.  
These frequencies **cannot be customized manually**, so you must select from the available options.

- It is recommended to choose a sampling frequency that is **slightly higher than your target rate**.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid unnecessarily high frequencies, as they may introduce noise or increase CPU load without improving data quality.

> üìò *Please refer to your device's official documentation for the exact list of supported sampling frequencies.*

‚ö†Ô∏è **These settings are locked once measurement begins.**

---

### Step 6: Click ‚ÄúSTART‚Äù to begin and select data save path


Before starting the measurement, set the **software sampling frequency** in the corresponding input box.  
This defines how often the program polls data from the connected devices.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
If the software sampling frequency is **higher than the actual data update rate of the device**, duplicated values may occur in the recorded data.  
Make sure the sampling frequency is properly configured based on your device‚Äôs performance and output interval.

Click the **START** button to begin the measurement. You will be prompted to choose a file path to save the output CSV file.




---

### Step 7: Click ‚ÄúSTOP‚Äù to end the measurement

![STOP](./img/stop.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Always click the **STOP** button to end the measurement before closing the program.  
Failing to do so may cause the devices to hang or become unresponsive.

---

## Chapter 3: Notes

- If a software error occurs during operation, click **"Continue"** to proceed.If the error persists, please click **"Stop"** use **NI MAX** to check whether the devices are properly connected and recognized by the system.
- If the program crashes or is interrupted due to an error:**Close and restart the program completely.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Since this program was developed using the LabVIEW Community Edition, continuing execution after an error may enter **edit mode**, where accidental changes to the block diagram can occur. Please avoid making any modifications unless you are debugging intentionally.
- If you encounter any bugs or have feature requests, please feel free to contact **YU**.
